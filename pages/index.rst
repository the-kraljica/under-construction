This is a place to experiment with web development, static site generators and technical writing. I was introduced to static site generators via `Hugo <https://gohugo.io/>`_, a fast and versatile SSG, based in GoLang. Now I want to see what a static site generator based in Python can do, so I'm trying out one called `Nikola <https://getnikola.com/>`_. 

I wrote down my favorite recipes as writing examples. Take a look!

* `Bean stew <link://slug/bean_stew>`_
* `Mushroom soup <link://slug/mushroom_soup>`_
* `Mayonnaise <link://slug/mayo>`_
