#. Chop the onions into small pieces. 
#. Put lard into a wide and deep pot. Put on low heat to melt the lard.

#. Put the soup vegetables into the pot. Pour water into the pot. Pour enough water to cover everything. 
#. Close the pot and let it simmer until the vegetables are soft. 
#. Chop the pork into small bits. 
#. Take the pot off of the stove and puree the vegetables. 
#. Put the pot back on the stove at medium heat. Add the beans and chopped meats to the pot. 
#. Add salt, pepper, tomato paste to season. 
#. Leave the stew to simmer for at least an hour. Leave it cooking for 2-3 hours if you can. The longer it simmers, the better it tastes.
